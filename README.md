# Surfs_up

## Overview

The purpouse of the anaylysis was to detemine weather patterns to better predict if a Ice Cream and Surf Shop would be viable to opne in Oahu. 


##Results

The rersults of the anayalsis show the following:

-The Average (mean) temperatures for June and December show only a 4 degree difference. 

- The Maximum Temperatures for June and December show only a 2 degree difference. 

- The Minimum Temperatures for June and December show an 8 degree difference with December dropping down to 56 degrees.

##Summary

Based on the temperature anaylsis, I would say the Ice Cream Surf Shop could be a viable venture. The winter months show similar temperatures to the summer months, which may indicate a consistant market for both ice cream and surfing. Additional anayalysis should be conducted to look at precipitation by month. I would also reccomend analizing the individual stataions to narrow down a location that may have favorable weather more often.
